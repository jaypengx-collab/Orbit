// ---- src/constants.js ----
// Plain constants shared across modules. Kept in
// their own leaf module (imports nothing) rather than declared in either
// one, because data.js and appearance.js import *from each other*
// (data.js needs appearance.js's normalize* functions, appearance.js used
// to need these two constants from data.js) - a real circular import, and
// unlike function declarations (hoisted, safe either way), a `const` read
// at another module's own top level can hit "Cannot access before
// initialization" depending on which side of the cycle evaluates first.
// It did, reliably, under the browser's native module loader (though not
// under every bundler's reordering, which is how this got missed at
// first). Moving the constants to a module neither side needs anything
// else from removes the cycle entirely instead of just working around one
// symptom of it.
// A rich indigo-violet paired with a vivid rose-magenta, not the generic
// iOS-system blue this used to be (#0A84FF/#5856D6) - that read as a stock
// system color rather than something Orbit actually chose, especially once
// it's the *only* color a first-time user sees before ever opening the
// style tool's other presets.

// The zh-TW weekday names, and the two day orders the app walks days in.
// Both used to be re-declared inline in every module that needed them (six
// copies of the label table, thirteen of the arrays), which is exactly the
// kind of thing that drifts one copy at a time. Keyed 0-6 to match
// Date.getDay(), so a lookup is `WEEKDAY_LABELS[day]` wherever a day number
// is already in hand.
