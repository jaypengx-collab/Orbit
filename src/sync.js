// ---- src/sync.js ----
// Optional cross-device sync: mirrors the already-saved schedule
// (state.applicationData) to a Firestore document and polls it for changes
// made from other devices. Reuses the same compressed v2 backup string the
// manual export/import flow already produces (editor-backup.js) as the
// document payload, so this is really "auto-paste the export text into a
// shared doc, auto-import it elsewhere" rather than a separate data format.
//
// No server of Orbit's own, in the sense that end users never run or pay
// for anything: every read/write goes through a Cloudflare Worker (see
// cloudflare-worker/orbit-worker.js's /sync path, VITE_ORBIT_SYNC_PROXY_URL)
// that the app's owner - not each user - deploys once. The Worker holds its
// own Firebase service-account credentials server-side and applies real,
// cross-request rate limiting, then proxies to Firestore - the same
// reasoning as gemini-ocr.js talking to the Gemini proxy instead of Gemini
// directly.
//
// One shared sync code plus a separate manager passcode - the passcode is
// the only thing "manager mode" is gated by, both here and server-side (see
// the Worker's handleSyncRequest): reading (GET) never needs it, anyone
// with the plain sync code can receive updates, exactly like the original
// single-code design. Only writing (PATCH) and deleting (DELETE) require
// the correct passcode - the Worker checks it against the hash it stored at
// creation time, so this isn't just a client-side convention any more.
//
// This feature simply doesn't work without VITE_ORBIT_SYNC_PROXY_URL set
// (see isSyncProxyConfigured) - same as gemini-ocr.js's AI import without
// its own proxy URL. There's no fallback to talking to Firestore directly
// from the browser any more: that path had no real rate limiting (Firestore
// rules can validate a request's shape but can't count requests), so it
// only ever made sense as a stopgap before this Worker existed.
