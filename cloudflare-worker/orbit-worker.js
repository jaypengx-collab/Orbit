// ---- cloudflare-worker/orbit-worker.js ----
// A single Cloudflare Worker serving Orbit Class's optional server-side
// features, plus one more app's sync feature, routed by path:
//
//   POST      /gemini     - AI schedule-photo import (see src/gemini-ocr.js).
//                            Holds the real Gemini API key server-side so
//                            end users never need one of their own.
//   GET/PATCH/DELETE /sync - Orbit's own cross-device schedule sync (see
//                            src/sync.js).
//   GET/PATCH/DELETE /vocab-sync - Orbit Vocab's cross-device
//                            progress sync (see that repo's sync.js). Not
//                            Orbit's own feature - this Worker is simply
//                            reused as shared infrastructure for a sibling
//                            static site, so its owner doesn't have to
//                            stand up and pay attention to a second Worker,
//                            a second Firebase project, or a second set of
//                            rate-limit tuning just to give that app the
//                            same kind of sync. See "==== /vocab-sync"
//                            below for how it differs from /sync.
//   POST      /vocab-ai   - Orbit Vocab's live, per-learner AI features
//                            (personalized mnemonics + memory-palace
//                            stories - see that repo's vocab-ai.js). Same
//                            reuse reasoning as /vocab-sync, but shares
//                            /gemini's GEMINI_API_KEY secret instead of
//                            /vocab-sync's Firebase ones - see "==== /vocab-ai"
//                            below.
//
// /sync and /vocab-sync both hold a Firebase service-account key
// server-side and proxy Firestore, so the pairing code isn't the only thing
// standing between the internet and that Firestore project. DELETE wipes
// the shared document outright on either path (see orbitSyncDeleteForEveryone
// and its vocab-sync equivalent).
//
// Combined into one file/one deployment purely for setup convenience - one
// Worker, one KV binding, one set of secrets to manage - not for any
// technical reason: Cloudflare's Workers Free plan daily request cap
// (100,000/day) is per-account, not per-Worker, so splitting these into
// separate Workers never bought any extra headroom in the first place. The
// same reasoning is why /vocab-sync reuses the *same* Firebase project and
// service-account credentials as /sync rather than needing its own - it
// only needs its own Firestore collection (see VOCAB_SYNC_APP below) and
// its own rate-limit counters, both cheap to add to an already-deployed
// Worker.
//
// All three routes have very different trust boundaries - /gemini only
// ever runs a fixed prompt against a submitted image, /sync holds
// credentials with full read/write access to Orbit's own shared documents,
// /vocab-sync the same but for a different app's documents - so each
// validates and rate-limits its own requests independently (see
// isRateLimited: every call passes its own `feature` key, so a burst
// against one path can never eat into another's quota) and no path touches
// another's secrets or code.
//
// Every feature is entirely optional. Not configuring GEMINI_API_KEY (see
// handleGeminiRequest) or the FIREBASE_* secrets (see handleSyncRequest,
// shared by /sync and /vocab-sync) just makes that path (or both sync
// paths at once, since they share the same Firebase secrets) return a "not
// configured" error - the other features still work normally. See README
// for the one-time setup each needs (paste this file into a new Worker in
// the Cloudflare dashboard, set whichever secrets apply, point the
// matching proxy-URL env var at this Worker's *.workers.dev URL with
// /gemini, /sync, or /vocab-sync appended).

// Real, cross-request rate limiting via Workers KV (env.RATE_LIMIT_KV - see
// README, an optional but recommended one-time binding), shared across
// every edge location - unlike a plain in-memory Map (kept below as
// isRateLimitedInMemory, used only as a fallback if the KV binding is
// missing or a KV call errors): Workers run many isolates in parallel
// across Cloudflare's edge, so an in-memory counter resets per isolate and
// a distributed burst of requests can blow straight through it. KV is
// still not a hard security boundary on its own (an abuser can spread
// requests across enough source IPs to dodge a per-IP counter), but it
// closes the specific gap of "just send enough requests to outrun a single
// isolate's memory." The real, unconditional backstop underneath both is
// Cloudflare's own free-plan daily request cap.

// reads/day but only 1,000 writes/day, per account, shared by every
// namespace. The original version of this function called kv.put() on
// every single request that wasn't already over its limit - one write just
// to increment the same counter by one - so a single feature under
// ordinary traffic (SYNC_READ_RATE_LIMIT alone allows 6000 requests/hour
// per IP) could burn through the *entire account's* daily write budget in
// minutes, at which point every kv.put() anywhere in this Worker starts
// throwing and every feature silently falls back to isRateLimitedInMemory
// (see the catch in isRateLimited below) - a noisy neighbor on one path
// degrading rate-limit accuracy on all the others.
//
// The fix batches increments per isolate instead of persisting each one to
// KV individually: the authoritative count is read from KV once per window
// (a read, not a write), and further increments in this isolate accumulate
// in memory (pendingCounters) and are flushed as a single write no more
// than once every KV_FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS. The limit check below still runs
// against base+delta on every request, so enforcement stays effectively
// real-time for whichever isolate is actually handling that traffic; only

// Exact copy of the prompt that used to live in src/gemini-ocr.js's
// AIVisionProcessor.buildPrompt() - kept here now instead, since the whole
// point of moving it server-side is that the client no longer sends it.
//
// Single-file, and self-classifying, deliberately: an earlier version split
// this into two separate fixed prompts (a "timetable" one and a
// "registration" one) and had the CLIENT decide, purely from upload order,
// which file went to which - file 1 was always assumed to be the timetable,
// every file after it a registration record. That broke completely the
// moment someone picked the files in the other order: the registration form
// got read as if it were a timetable grid (producing garbage), and the
// actual timetable photo got read as if it were a course list (finding
// nothing to extract). There is no reliable signal in upload order - a file
// picker doesn't know or care what's in the files - so the model has to
// determine this itself instead of trusting how the files arrived. Every
// file now gets exactly this one prompt, and "documentKind" is the model's
// own answer to "what am I looking at", read back by
// src/gemini-ocr.js's recognizeAndMerge to route each file's result
// correctly regardless of what order it was uploaded in.
//
// This does cost a little more per call than the two-separate-prompts
// version did (every call now carries both rule sets, not just the one that
// turned out to matter) - a fixed, modest, worthwhile trade for a bug class
// this is not: getting the whole import right no matter what order the
// files came in, rather than getting it cheaply and only when they came in
// the order the code silently assumed.
// A function of "today" rather than a plain constant: countdownEvents below
// needs a reference date so the model can resolve a year-less calendar date
// (e.g. a poster showing only "1/22", no year) to the correct year itself,
// instead of guessing one with no anchor at all - which in practice skewed
// toward whatever year the model's training data made it default to, often
// landing the "countdown" in the past. Computed fresh per request rather
// than once at module load, since a Worker instance can stay warm across
// requests spanning a real date change.

{
  "documentKind": "timetable",
  "bellTimes": [],
  "breakTimes": [{"name":"午休","start":"12:00","end":"13:00"}],
  "classes": [{"key":"c1","subject":"國文","teacher":"陳老師","location":"A101"}, {"key":"c2","subject":"英文","teacher":"王老師","location":"B202"}],
  "weeklySchedule": {"1": ["c1","c2",null], "2": [], "3": [], "4": [], "5": []},
  "reverseWeek": false,
  "courses": [{"subject":"多媒體音樂 I","teacher":"徐蓉莉","location":"","day":1,"periods":[3,4]}],
  "countdownEvents": [{"name":"116 學測","startDate":"2027-01-22","endDate":"2027-01-24"}]
}

First, set "documentKind" to exactly one of:
- "timetable" - the file shows a weekly class schedule grid: a table with days as one axis and periods as the other, each cell showing a subject (and often a teacher/room) for a whole week.
- "registration" - the file is a course-registration confirmation, enrollment list, or similar record: a list or table where each row names one specific course a student is actually taking, generally alongside which day and period(s) it meets. It does NOT show a full weekly grid.
- "other" - neither of the above (an unrelated photo, a notice with no course rows or grid, etc).

Then extract only the fields that match the documentKind you chose, and leave every other field at its empty default (empty array, empty object, or false) rather than guessing or leaving it inconsistent with documentKind. countdownEvents is the one exception - check for it regardless of documentKind, per its own rule below.

If documentKind is "timetable", fill in bellTimes/breakTimes/classes/weeklySchedule/reverseWeek (leave courses as an empty array):
- Read class period times from the image when available. Use 24-hour "HH:MM" strings, one entry per period in order, exactly as shown (either ["08:10","09:00"] or {"start":"08:10","end":"09:00"} is acceptable). Preserve the actual times; never invent, guess, or fall back to standard/default school times. If no class times are visible anywhere, return an empty bellTimes array.
- Identify visible subjects, teachers, classrooms, breaks, and other timetable information.
- classes: one entry per distinct subject actually visible in the photo — do not invent subjects that aren't shown. "key" is your own short identifier for that entry (e.g. "c1", "c2") — it is never shown to anyone, it only links weeklySchedule slots back to this entry, so make each one unique. "subject" is the full Chinese subject name. Use "" for teacher/location when that information is not readable.
- Every entry in classes MUST be placed at least once in weeklySchedule, at the exact day/period position where it visually appears in the grid. A subject you cannot place at a specific day and period is not a recognized class — leave it out of classes entirely rather than adding it unassigned. Do not stop at recognizing a subject's name; always also locate the cell(s) it occupies.
- weeklySchedule: keys "1" through "5" (Monday–Friday) are REQUIRED and must all be present, even as an empty array — never omit or truncate "5" (Friday) even if it is partially cut off in the photo. Add "6" (Saturday) and/or "0" (Sunday) ONLY if the photo actually shows a column for that day; otherwise omit them entirely. Keep each day's array aligned with the detected periods (one entry per bellTimes index). Use null when a slot is genuinely empty or cannot be identified — never fill a blank or unreadable cell by copying in a class from a different day or period just because a slot exists there; every non-null entry must be a "key" that exists in classes.
- If odd/even weeks contain alternatives in the same slot (shown as two stacked subject+teacher pairs, often marked 單/雙 or "odd/even"), read each alternative's subject and its own teacher as two separate pieces of text first, then combine same-role pieces with "/" — all subjects joined into one "/"-separated subject string, all teachers joined the same way into one "/"-separated teacher string, both in the same left-to-right order, as one shared classes entry for that slot. Never fold a teacher's name into the subject string, or vice versa: subject must end up containing only subject names, teacher only teacher names.
- Set reverseWeek to true only when the photo clearly indicates a reversed odd/even week orientation; otherwise false.
- Add breakTimes only for explicitly shown non-class periods such as lunch or cleaning — not empty/free periods.

If documentKind is "registration", fill in courses (leave bellTimes/breakTimes/classes/weeklySchedule empty, reverseWeek false):
- This kind of file's day/period information may be written out plainly, or packed together compactly — one shorthand seen often enough to call out explicitly: a single day character immediately followed by a run of digits with no separator, where each individual digit is its own period number (so a two-digit run like "34" means periods 3 AND 4, both occupied by that one row, never "period 34" or a "3 through 4" range). Whatever notation this file actually uses, decode it using the day-naming and period-numbering it establishes itself.
- courses: one entry per distinct course row actually shown — do not invent rows. "day" is an integer: 1 for Monday through 5 for Friday, 6 for Saturday, 0 for Sunday. "periods" is every period number that row's course occupies, as a plain array of integers in ascending order (e.g. a row spanning two consecutive periods is periods:[3,4], never a combined number like 34 or a string). Use "" for teacher/location when not given or not legible.

Regardless of documentKind:
- Add countdownEvents only for clearly visible events/exams with a readable calendar date, formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD". Set startDate and endDate to the same date for a single-day event; use the visible first and last dates for a multi-day event/exam period. Only include dates you can actually read the day and month of; otherwise return an empty array. A file can carry a countdown/exam notice with no timetable or course-list content at all (documentKind "other") - still report it.
- Today's date is ${todayIso}. If a countdown/exam date shows a day and month but no visible year, infer the year yourself so the resulting date is the nearest upcoming date on or after today: use this year unless that month/day has already passed this year, in which case use next year instead. Never infer a year that puts the event in the past. If a year is actually visible in the photo, always use that one instead, even if it looks like it's already past.
- Do not invent information. When uncertain, prefer an empty value, empty array, or null.
- Every field in the response schema you are given must be present, even when empty.
- Keep all fields internally consistent.
- Return ONLY the raw JSON object — no markdown fences, no comments, no extra text.`;

//
// gemini-3.6-flash is gone too, for a worse reason: run against this

// classes. Both look like the same underlying problem: this model version
// misbehaving specifically under schema-constrained decoding. A fallback
// that can silently cost 94 seconds and still fail is worse than having no
// fallback there at all, since the retry loop below waits through the full
// thing before ever trying the next model.
//
// gemini-3.8-flash, the newest release, was tried as a replacement and
// rejected for a different reason: three attempts with backoff all came
// back 503 "high demand" - it simply isn't reliably available yet, not a
// correctness problem. Worth reconsidering once it's out of that state.

// call rather than that repo's offline batch script
// (scripts/generate_ai_signals.py, which pre-generates one static
// confusedWith/mnemonic/priorDifficulty per word into data/ai_signals.json
// at build time): each request here depends on THIS learner's own data -
// their actual recorded wrong-answer history for one word, or which
// specific handful of words they're reviewing right now - which a
// build-time batch job run once for every word in the vocabulary has no
// way to know.
//   - kind: "mnemonic" - one memory hook targeted at a specific word's
//     recorded wrong-answer pattern for THIS learner, not the generic
//     one-per-word hook data/ai_signals.json already ships offline.
//   - kind: "story" - one short story weaving together a handful of this
//     learner's current 答錯待複習/學習中 words as a memory-palace-style
//     group mnemonic, reviewed together instead of word-by-word.
// No passcode/identity check here (unlike /vocab-sync) - this isn't tied to
// any one learner's sync pairing, so it uses the same trust model /gemini
// already does: rate-limited by IP and gated by GEMINI_API_KEY, callable by
// anyone who knows the URL (CORS only stops a browser from a disallowed
// origin reading the response, not a direct request from reaching this
// far - see readGeminiFiles/cleanVocabAiText's own comments for why every
// field is still treated as untrusted input regardless). Its own rate-limit
// bucket ('vocab-ai', see isRateLimited's `feature` keying) means abuse here
// can never eat into /gemini's or /vocab-sync's own quota, and vice versa -
// same reasoning as every other route in this file.

// Reuses /gemini's own GEMINI_API_KEY secret (see handleGeminiRequest) -
// nothing new to configure once AI 辨識課表照片 is already set up. Not
// client-selectable (unlike /gemini's own `model` field): both features here

// ==== /sync - cross-device sync proxy =======================================
//
// Requires more setup than /gemini, because closing the gap properly means
// closing Firestore's direct, ruleset-gated door entirely - otherwise an
// abuser just skips this Worker and hits Firestore directly, same as
// before. That means:
//   1. This Worker authenticates to Firestore as a Google Cloud *service
//      account* (FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL / FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY below), not
//      as an anonymous client. Service-account access is treated the same
//      as the Admin SDK: it bypasses Firestore Security Rules entirely, by
//      design - the rules only ever gated unauthenticated client access.
//   2. Once this Worker is live, set the Firestore rule for
//      /orbit-schedules/{doc} to `allow read, write: if false`. That
//      closes the direct-client door completely - real, unauthenticated
//      public access - since actual devices now only ever reach this
//      Worker, and this Worker's own traffic to Firestore ignores that
//      rule anyway (see point 1). See README's cross-device sync section
//      for the exact rule text and the full one-time setup this needs.
//
// One shared sync code plus a separate manager passcode, with the passcode
// gating *only* write access - not two parallel codes:
//   - Creating a sync (POST, below) mints a plain sync code (the document's
//     own ID, same as the original single-code design) and a separate,
//     unrelated *manager passcode*, returning both to the caller once. Only
//     the passcode's SHA-256 hash is ever stored, as `managerPasscodeHash`
//     on the document, so a leak of the Firestore data itself can't be
//     turned back into a working passcode.
//   - GET (read/poll) never needs the passcode - anyone with the sync code
//     can read, exactly like the original design. Optionally supplying
//     `&passcode=` resolves whether that passcode is *this* document's
//     manager passcode (`role: 'manager'` in the response if so) - used at
//     join time and by an already-joined device unlocking manager mode
//     later, never by ordinary polling.
//   - PATCH (write) and DELETE both require the correct passcode - in the
//     JSON body for PATCH, as a query param for DELETE (which this app
//     never sends a body with). Missing or wrong passcode is a 403,
//     distinct from a nonexistent/mistyped code (its own message) - this is
//     the actual fix for what used to be true only by UI convention
//     (src/sync.js's applyEditorRoleLock): previously *any* holder of the
//     single code could PATCH or DELETE, because there was nothing else to
//     check.

// Must match the code/passcode format the client (and this Worker's own
// generateSyncCode below) produce - rejecting a malformed code here means

// one learner's own devices, and every operation (including a plain read)
// already needs the real secret. Rather than mint a separate public "code"
// alongside a passcode the way /sync does (which would just be one more
// string to type/copy for no security benefit here - see that app's own
// sync.js), /vocab-sync uses ONE random string as both the pairing's
// identifier and its only credential: the client sends it as `?passcode=`
// on every request, and this Worker derives the actual Firestore document
// id from it (see docIdForPasscode below) rather than ever using it, or
// anything derived from it, as a client-facing lookup key on its own.
//
// Longer than Orbit's own 8-character code/passcode (see SYNC_CODE_LENGTH)
// specifically because it's now the ONLY secret guarding a learner's
// progress, not one of two. 16 characters from the same 32-symbol alphabet
// is 80 bits of entropy (32^16) - comfortably beyond brute-force range even

// more (unlike an earlier revision of this design): every read already
// carries and checks the passcode, so there's no passcode-less "just
