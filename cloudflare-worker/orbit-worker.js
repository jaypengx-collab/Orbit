// ---- cloudflare-worker/orbit-worker.js ----
// A single Cloudflare Worker serving Orbit Class's optional server-side
// features, plus one more app's sync feature, routed by path:
//
//   POST      /gemini     - AI schedule-photo import (see src/gemini-ocr.js).
//                            Holds the real Gemini API key server-side so
//                            end users never need one of their own.
//   GET/PATCH/DELETE /sync - Orbit's own cross-device schedule sync (see
//                            src/sync.js).
//   GET/PATCH/DELETE /vocab-sync - English Vocabulary Tool's cross-device
//                            progress sync (see that repo's sync.js). Not
//                            Orbit's own feature - this Worker is simply
//                            reused as shared infrastructure for a sibling
//                            static site, so its owner doesn't have to
//                            stand up and pay attention to a second Worker,
//                            a second Firebase project, or a second set of
//                            rate-limit tuning just to give that app the
//                            same kind of sync. See "==== /vocab-sync"
//                            below for how it differs from /sync.
//
// /sync and /vocab-sync both hold a Firebase service-account key
// server-side and proxy Firestore, so the pairing code isn't the only thing
// standing between the internet and that Firestore project. DELETE wipes
// the shared document outright on either path (see orbitSyncDeleteForEveryone
// and its vocab-sync equivalent).
//
// Combined into one file/one deployment purely for setup convenience - one
// Worker, one KV binding, one set of secrets to manage - not for any
// technical reason: Cloudflare's Workers Free plan daily request cap
// (100,000/day) is per-account, not per-Worker, so splitting these into
// separate Workers never bought any extra headroom in the first place. The
// same reasoning is why /vocab-sync reuses the *same* Firebase project and
// service-account credentials as /sync rather than needing its own - it
// only needs its own Firestore collection (see VOCAB_SYNC_APP below) and
// its own rate-limit counters, both cheap to add to an already-deployed
// Worker.
//
// All three routes have very different trust boundaries - /gemini only
// ever runs a fixed prompt against a submitted image, /sync holds
// credentials with full read/write access to Orbit's own shared documents,
// /vocab-sync the same but for a different app's documents - so each
// validates and rate-limits its own requests independently (see
// isRateLimited: every call passes its own `feature` key, so a burst
// against one path can never eat into another's quota) and no path touches
// another's secrets or code.
//
// Every feature is entirely optional. Not configuring GEMINI_API_KEY (see
// handleGeminiRequest) or the FIREBASE_* secrets (see handleSyncRequest,
// shared by /sync and /vocab-sync) just makes that path (or both sync
// paths at once, since they share the same Firebase secrets) return a "not
// configured" error - the other features still work normally. See README
// for the one-time setup each needs (paste this file into a new Worker in
// the Cloudflare dashboard, set whichever secrets apply, point the
// matching proxy-URL env var at this Worker's *.workers.dev URL with
// /gemini, /sync, or /vocab-sync appended).

// Real, cross-request rate limiting via Workers KV (env.RATE_LIMIT_KV - see
// README, an optional but recommended one-time binding), shared across
// every edge location - unlike a plain in-memory Map (kept below as
// isRateLimitedInMemory, used only as a fallback if the KV binding is
// missing or a KV call errors): Workers run many isolates in parallel
// across Cloudflare's edge, so an in-memory counter resets per isolate and
// a distributed burst of requests can blow straight through it. KV is
// still not a hard security boundary on its own (an abuser can spread
// requests across enough source IPs to dodge a per-IP counter), but it
// closes the specific gap of "just send enough requests to outrun a single
// isolate's memory." The real, unconditional backstop underneath both is
// Cloudflare's own free-plan daily request cap.

// reads/day but only 1,000 writes/day, per account, shared by every
// namespace. The original version of this function called kv.put() on
// every single request that wasn't already over its limit - one write just
// to increment the same counter by one - so a single feature under
// ordinary traffic (SYNC_READ_RATE_LIMIT alone allows 6000 requests/hour
// per IP) could burn through the *entire account's* daily write budget in
// minutes, at which point every kv.put() anywhere in this Worker starts
// throwing and every feature silently falls back to isRateLimitedInMemory
// (see the catch in isRateLimited below) - a noisy neighbor on one path
// degrading rate-limit accuracy on all the others.
//
// The fix batches increments per isolate instead of persisting each one to
// KV individually: the authoritative count is read from KV once per window
// (a read, not a write), and further increments in this isolate accumulate
// in memory (pendingCounters) and are flushed as a single write no more
// than once every KV_FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS. The limit check below still runs
// against base+delta on every request, so enforcement stays effectively

// AIVisionProcessor.buildPrompt() - kept here now instead, since the whole
// point of moving it server-side is that the client no longer sends it.
const GEMINI_PROMPT = `Extract the class timetable from the attached file(s) and return it as a single JSON object. Focus on the timetable only — ignore background, margins, decorations, and unrelated content; it may only occupy part of the frame.

When more than one file is attached, they describe ONE timetable together, not several: read all of them first, then answer once. They are given in the order the user chose them, and a later file is normally there to fill in or correct what an earlier one left vague — for example a timetable photo with placeholder or generic slot names followed by a screenshot of the student's own enrolled classes, where the second file supplies the real subject and teacher names for the first file's slots. Prefer the more specific, more legible source for any given detail, and prefer a later file when two disagree about the same slot. Never emit a slot twice because two files showed it. Examine EVERY attached file on its own for countdownEvents — an exam banner, calendar, or notice can appear in any one of them regardless of which file has the timetable grid, so do not stop looking once the first file has been read.

Return valid JSON only, matching this exact schema:
{
  "bellTimes": [],
  "breakTimes": [{"name":"午休","start":"12:00","end":"13:00"}],
  "classes": [{"key":"c1","subject":"國文","teacher":"陳老師","location":"A101"}, {"key":"c2","subject":"英文","teacher":"王老師","location":"B202"}],
  "weeklySchedule": {"1": ["c1","c2",null], "2": [], "3": [], "4": [], "5": []},
  "reverseWeek": false,
  "countdownEvents": [{"name":"116 學測","startDate":"2027-01-22","endDate":"2027-01-24"}]
}

Interpret the timetable visually and use your best judgment to reconstruct its structure. Rules:
- Read class period times from the image when available. Use 24-hour "HH:MM" strings, one entry per period in order, exactly as shown (either ["08:10","09:00"] or {"start":"08:10","end":"09:00"} is acceptable). Preserve the actual times; never invent, guess, or fall back to standard/default school times. If no class times are visible anywhere, return an empty bellTimes array.
- Identify visible subjects, teachers, classrooms, breaks, and other timetable information.
- classes: one entry per distinct subject actually visible in the photo — do not invent subjects that aren't shown. "key" is your own short identifier for that entry (e.g. "c1", "c2") — it is never shown to anyone, it only links weeklySchedule slots back to this entry, so make each one unique. "subject" is the full Chinese subject name. Use "" for teacher/location when that information is not readable.
- Every entry in classes MUST be placed at least once in weeklySchedule, at the exact day/period position where it visually appears in the grid. A subject you cannot place at a specific day and period is not a recognized class — leave it out of classes entirely rather than adding it unassigned. Do not stop at recognizing a subject's name; always also locate the cell(s) it occupies.
- weeklySchedule: keys "1" through "5" (Monday–Friday) are REQUIRED and must all be present, even as an empty array — never omit or truncate "5" (Friday) even if it is partially cut off in the photo. Add "6" (Saturday) and/or "0" (Sunday) ONLY if the photo actually shows a column for that day; otherwise omit them entirely. Keep each day's array aligned with the detected periods (one entry per bellTimes index). Use null when a slot is genuinely empty or cannot be identified; every non-null entry must be a "key" that exists in classes.
- If odd/even weeks contain alternatives in the same slot, combine them with "/" (e.g. "國文/公民") in both subject and teacher, using one shared classes entry for that slot.
- Set reverseWeek to true only when the photo clearly indicates a reversed odd/even week orientation; otherwise false.
- Add breakTimes only for explicitly shown non-class periods such as lunch or cleaning — not empty/free periods.
- Add countdownEvents only for clearly visible events/exams with a readable calendar date, formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD". Set startDate and endDate to the same date for a single-day event; use the visible first and last dates for a multi-day event/exam period. Only include dates you can actually read; otherwise return an empty array. This applies per file, not just to whichever file has the main timetable grid — a countdown/exam notice can be the ONLY thing a given file shows, with no timetable content at all, and must still be reported.
- Do not invent information. When uncertain, prefer an empty value or null. Combining two files is not inventing; guessing at something neither of them shows is.
- Every field in the response schema you are given must be present, even when empty.
- Keep all fields internally consistent.
- Return ONLY the raw JSON object — no markdown fences, no comments, no extra text.`;

// gemini-2.5-flash, which used to close out this list, is gone rather than
// demoted: confirmed live against the real API (not assumed from a
// changelog) that it now 404s for every caller - "no longer available to
// new users" - so keeping it in the fallback chain would only ever waste a
// retry.
//
// gemini-3.6-flash is gone too, for a worse reason: run against this
// feature's actual prompt+schema+multi-file request shape (not just
// pinged), it reproduced two separate real failures, not a one-off - a
// single-file request that burned through 24576 output tokens over 94
// seconds before finally coming back truncated and unusable, and a
// multi-file request that came back fast but recognized just 1 of 12
// classes. Both look like the same underlying problem: this model version
// misbehaving specifically under schema-constrained decoding. A fallback
// that can silently cost 94 seconds and still fail is worse than having no
// fallback there at all, since the retry loop below waits through the full
// thing before ever trying the next model.
//
// gemini-3.8-flash, the newest release, was tried as a replacement and
// rejected for a different reason: three attempts with backoff all came
// back 503 "high demand" - it simply isn't reliably available yet, not a
// correctness problem. Worth reconsidering once it's out of that state.
//
// That leaves two, both verified correct and reasonably fast on repeated
// single- and multi-file live runs.

// The exact shape src/gemini-ocr.js's normalizeAIOutput() reads back,
// handed to the model as a response schema rather than only described in
// prompt prose. Constrained decoding is the single biggest lever this proxy
// has on how long a request takes: the model can no longer spend output
// tokens on a markdown fence, a preamble, a trailing explanation or a
// differently-shaped object, so there are simply fewer tokens to generate,
// and the client's own fence-stripping/brace-hunting salvage path in
// parseResponse() stops being the normal case. It is not a substitute for
// the prompt - the prompt still says what to extract and what not to invent
// - only for the half of it that describes JSON punctuation.
//
// Deliberately loose in one place: bellTimes/breakTimes times stay plain
// strings (normalizeTime() already accepts and repairs several forms, and a
// stricter pattern would make the model drop a period it could otherwise
// half-read); weeklySchedule is a fixed set of seven arrays because a schema
// cannot express "these keys are required, the others optional".
//
// classes is an ARRAY of {key, subject, teacher, location} objects, not the
// free-form {subjectKey: [subject, teacher, location]} map an earlier
// version of this schema used. That map is impossible to describe here:
// Gemini's response_schema is the OpenAPI-3.0 subset Schema object, which -
// confirmed empirically against the real API, not just the docs - has no
// `additionalProperties`. A request that tried to schema-constrain a
// free-form map's values was rejected outright with a 400 before the model
// ever ran, for every model, every time; dropping the constraint down to a
// bare `type: 'object'` (so it was schema-legal but told the model nothing
// about what belonged inside it) made the model leave the field empty far
// more often than not - nothing about an undescribed nested object signals
// "you are still expected to fill this in". An array of fully-typed objects
// has neither problem: it is legal to describe field-by-field, and it gives
// the model exactly as much structure as the map version's prose used to.
// See src/gemini-ocr.js's normalizeAIOutput() for how "key" gets turned back
// into the app's own internal id.

// ==== /sync - cross-device sync proxy =======================================
//
// Requires more setup than /gemini, because closing the gap properly means
// closing Firestore's direct, ruleset-gated door entirely - otherwise an
// abuser just skips this Worker and hits Firestore directly, same as
// before. That means:
//   1. This Worker authenticates to Firestore as a Google Cloud *service
//      account* (FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL / FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY below), not
//      as an anonymous client. Service-account access is treated the same
//      as the Admin SDK: it bypasses Firestore Security Rules entirely, by
//      design - the rules only ever gated unauthenticated client access.
//   2. Once this Worker is live, set the Firestore rule for
//      /orbit-schedules/{doc} to `allow read, write: if false`. That
//      closes the direct-client door completely - real, unauthenticated
//      public access - since actual devices now only ever reach this
//      Worker, and this Worker's own traffic to Firestore ignores that
//      rule anyway (see point 1). See README's cross-device sync section
//      for the exact rule text and the full one-time setup this needs.
//
// One shared sync code plus a separate manager passcode, with the passcode
// gating *only* write access - not two parallel codes:
//   - Creating a sync (POST, below) mints a plain sync code (the document's
//     own ID, same as the original single-code design) and a separate,
//     unrelated *manager passcode*, returning both to the caller once. Only
//     the passcode's SHA-256 hash is ever stored, as `managerPasscodeHash`
//     on the document, so a leak of the Firestore data itself can't be
//     turned back into a working passcode.
//   - GET (read/poll) never needs the passcode - anyone with the sync code
//     can read, exactly like the original design. Optionally supplying
//     `&passcode=` resolves whether that passcode is *this* document's
//     manager passcode (`role: 'manager'` in the response if so) - used at
//     join time and by an already-joined device unlocking manager mode
//     later, never by ordinary polling.
//   - PATCH (write) and DELETE both require the correct passcode - in the
//     JSON body for PATCH, as a query param for DELETE (which this app
//     never sends a body with). Missing or wrong passcode is a 403,
//     distinct from a nonexistent/mistyped code (its own message) - this is
//     the actual fix for what used to be true only by UI convention
//     (src/sync.js's applyEditorRoleLock): previously *any* holder of the
//     single code could PATCH or DELETE, because there was nothing else to
//     check.

// Must match the code/passcode format the client (and this Worker's own
// generateSyncCode below) produce - rejecting a malformed code here means
// it never even reaches Firestore, and the error message is the same
// either way. Passcodes reuse the exact same shape - they're just another
// random string from the same alphabet, generated the same way.
